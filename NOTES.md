- Suite of features help you to scale beyond the prototyping stage.
- Features to demonstrate:
    - Different index types and configurations can optimize speed/accuracy/memory trade-offs
        - Single vector vs multiple, named vectors
            - Show both, then go with multiple vectors for the rest of the demo
        - Vector index types:
            - HNSW
            - Flat
            - Dynamic
        - Quantization: SQ / PQ / BQ
            - Available quantization settings & impact
    - Multi-tenancy
        - When to use MT
        - How to set up multi-tenancy
        - How to use MT collections
    - Horizontal scaling
        - Show multi-node cluster operations
            - Show nodes endpoint / nodes info from the client
            - Explain Raft introduction from 1.25 onwards
            - Show replication
